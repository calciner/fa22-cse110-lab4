1. print number 3 at line 12.
2. line 13 will dispaly number 150, it is the final value of discountedPrice in the for loop.
3. line 14 will dispaly number 150, it is the final value of finalPrice in the for loop.
4. the function return a array [ 50, 100, 150 ].these three number is the discounted price. in the function discountPrices, it will return a array thant contains the discounted price from the input price array.
5. line 12 will causes an error, because i is in the for block, cannot be access outside of the for block. so in line 12, i is not defined.
6. line 13 will causes an error, because discountedPrice is let type data, it cannot be access outsid eof the for block. so in line 13, discountedPrice is not defined.
7. line 14 will display the string 150, the finalPrice is let type data, line 14, for loop and the diclaration of finalPrice are in the same block. so the finalPrice in line 14 will be the last for loop value. 
8. the function return a array [ 50, 100, 150 ]. because the let type data will be access inside the for loop, finalPriec will be push in the array discounted, and the array will be return for the output of the function.
9. line 11 will causes an error, because i is in the for block, cannot be access outside of the for block. so in line 12, i is not defined. 
10. line 12 will return 3, because length is a constant, the diclaration of length variable and line 12 are in the same block.
11. function will return array [ 50, 100, 150 ], because discounted is const type array, array in javascript can not be constant, it just a constant reference, but the data inside the constant array is dynamic.

15. (==) is equality operator, it can compare two values with different data type, integer 2 and string '2' will return true because they refer the same things.numbers and strings with different length will reutrn false. (===) is strict equality operator, if the compared two value are not the same type, strict equality operator will return false, other remain the same sa (==).

17. the result will be [ 2, 4, 6 ], when call the function modifyArray, the function require two parameter, one is array, one is a function. inside the modifyArray function, it will use the doSomathing function to modify the array elment value and create a new array. because the parameter funciont is double the number, so the return array will double the value for every element.
